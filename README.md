There are two small files both are concerned with applying and calling back functions in order to create some level of composition. In part 1 + 2 the goal is to 
create 3 separate functions for 3 separate shapes which all can have varying size, shape, and color which can be defined through calling the function rather than as 
a set value. Part 3 works the same but with sprites and an added application of if/else when the mouse is pressed which changes the visible composition.
